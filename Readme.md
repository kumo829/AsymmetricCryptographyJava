# Demo project on the usage of RSA keys to cypher and decipher Strings and Files using Java and Bouncy Castle

This project showcase the use of Asymmetric RSA keys to encrypt and decrypts files and Strings.

The private key is used to cypher the message and the public key is used to decipher it (It can also work the other way around, though)
